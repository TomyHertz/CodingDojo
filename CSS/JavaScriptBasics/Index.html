        <div id="div_tres"><p1>  JavaScript is a cross-platform, objet oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take in a bunch of differente directions. JavaScript lives inside a host enviroment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objets of these enviroments to provide programmatic control over them.</p1>
        <ul>
            <li>Variable Declaration JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers, var x;</li>
            <li>Variable Assignment Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup now can have a coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x = 10;</li>
            <li>Data Types Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript: Boolean - true or fale; null aka nothing; Number -42 or 3.14159; String -"Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array -[1,"Coding", 2,"Dojo"]; abd Object - {first_name:"Jane",last_name:"Doe"}</li>
            <li>Conditionals When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decsisions - hitting differnt code blocks vased on values or conditions taht have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: if a specificed condition is true, do this code in our code block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we excetute this block of code.</li>
            <li>Loops There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
            <li>Function Funcitons are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. as an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over and over again.</li>
